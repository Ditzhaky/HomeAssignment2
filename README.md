# HomeAssignment2
This is a website about my professional and personal life... about my hobbies, passions and more... I learned a lot as I made progress with the project... I faced a lot of challenges. One big challenge I face for example is to fix the script I wrote because it didn't work when I tried to open the sites via github (some functions didn't work). I did a lot of reasearch in the internet and managed to fix the problem. I think I made a lot of progress from my first page!! Sometimes the page looks fine locally but when I open it via github it has a lot of problems. I hope I could understabd why this things happen.
